abstract = {The strong dependence between cortical bone elasticity at the millimetre-scale (mesoscale) and cortical porosity has been evidenced by previous studies. However, bone is an anisotropic composite material made by mineral, proteins and water assembled in a hierarchical structure. Whether the variations of structural and compositional properties of bone affect the different elastic coefficients at the mesoscale is not clear. Aiming to understand the relationships between bone elastic properties and compositions and microstructure, we applied state-of-the-art experimental modalities to assess these aspects of bone characteristics. All elastic coefficients (stiffness tensor of the transverse isotropic bone material), structure of the vascular pore network, collagen and mineral properties were measured in 52 specimens from the femoral diaphysis of 26 elderly donors. Statistical analyses and micromechanical modeling showed that vascular pore volume fraction and the degree of mineralization of bone are the most important determinants of cortical bone anisotropic mesoscopic elasticity. Though significant correlations were observed between collagen properties and elasticity, their effects in bone mesoscopic elasticity were minor in our data. This work also provides a unique set of data exhibiting a range of variations of compositional and microstructural cortical bone properties in the elderly and gives strong experimental evidence and basis for further development of biomechanical models for human cortical bone.
Statement of Significance
This study reports the relationships between microstructure, composition and the mesoscale anisotropic elastic properties of human femoral cortical bone in elderly. For the first time, we provide data covering the complete anisotropic elastic tensor, the microstructure of cortical vascular porosity, mineral and collagen characteristics obtained from the same or adjacent samples in each donor. The results revealed that cortical vascular porosity and degree of mineralization of bone are the most important determinants of bone anisotropic stiffness at the mesoscale. The presented data gives strong experimental evidence and basis for further development of biomechanical models for human cortical bone.}

abstract = {Elasticity assessment based on bulk wave velocity (BWV) measurements is the most popular technique to characterize the anisotropic stiffness tensor in cortical bone. Typically, a cuboid bone specimen is cut with its sides along the different anatomical directions. Then, the velocity of shear and longitudinal waves propagating along different directions are assessed, from which stiffness coefficients are calculated. Despite the importance of obtaining accurate elasticity values for bone research, there is no generally accepted protocol to measure BWV and the precision of the technique has been seldom investigated. The purpose of this work is to critically assess the method to measure BWV on cuboid specimens in terms of ultrasound frequency, specimen size and signal processing technique. In this study, we measured polycarbonate specimens of different dimensions and 55 human bone specimens with different transducers using frequencies ranging from 2.25 to 10MHz and 1–5MHz for longitudinal and shear waves, respectively. We compared four signal processing methods to detect the wave arrival time. The main results are that, (1) the measurement of shear waves is more complex than that of longitudinal wave, being less precise and more sensitive to sample size; (2) the estimated stiffness depends on the signal processing technique used (up to 10% variation for shear coefficients of bone); and (3) bone stiffness assessed from BWV using the first arrival of the signal to determine the time-of-flight is not different from stiffness assessed using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). These results evidence that the measurement method can have an effect on the stiffness values estimates and hence, a well-defined protocol is needed to accurately measure bone stiffness coefficients based on BWV.}

abstract = {In the study of mechanical properties of human bone, specimens may be defatted before experiments to prevent contamination and the risk of infections. High energy synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-μCT) is a popular technique to study bone microstructure. However, little is known about the effects of defatting or irradiation during SR-μCT imaging on different elastic coefficients including shear and longitudinal moduli in different anatomical directions. In this work, these effects are evaluated on a set of 24 samples using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), which allows one to accurately measure the complete set of elastic coefficients of cortical bone non destructively. The results show that defatting with diethylether and methanol and irradiation up to 2.5kGy has no detectable effect on any of the elastic coefficients of human cortical bone.}

abstract = {The material properties of the trabeculae (tissue-level properties), together with the trabecular architecture and the bone volume fraction determine the apparent millimetre-scale bone mechanical properties. We present a novel method to measure trabecular tissue elastic modulus Et using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). The first mechanical resonance frequency fe of a freestanding cuboid specimen is measured and used to back-calculate Et. The steps of the back-calculation are (1) the apparent stiffness tensors C(Et˜) is computed using micro-finite elements for a set of trial values of tissue Young's modulus Et˜ based on the computed tomography image of the specimen; (2) the modeled free-vibration resonance frequencies fm(Et˜) of the specimen is calculated with the Rayleigh-Ritz method using C(Et˜); (3) finally, Et is obtained by interpolation using fe and fm(Et˜). Four bovine bone specimens were tested (nominal size 5×6 ×6mm3). Average (standard deviation) of Et was 13.12 (1.06)GPa. The measurement of a single resonance frequency enabled an estimation of tissue elasticity in line with available data. RUS is a non destructive technique relatively easy to implement compared to traditional mechanical testing. The novel method could contribute to a better documentation of bone tissue elasticity which is an important parameter of micro-finite element analyses for the clinical assessment of bone strength.}

abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate whether ultrasonic velocities in cortical bone can be considered as a proxy for mechanical quality of cortical bone tissue reflected by porosity and compression strength. Micro-computed tomography, compression mechanical testing and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy were used to assess, respectively, porosity, strength and velocity of bulk waves of both shear and longitudinal polarisations propagating along and perpendicular to osteons, in 92 cortical bone specimens from tibia and femur of elderly human donors. All velocities were significantly associated with strength (r = 0.65–0.83) and porosity (r = –0.64 to –0.77). Roughly, according to linear regression models, a decrease in velocity of 100 m/s corresponded to a loss of 20 MPa in strength (which is approximately 10% of the largest strength value) and to an increase in porosity of 5%. These results provide a rationale for the in vivo measurement of one or several velocities for the diagnosis of bone fragility.}
